# ComfyUI_Ultimate_SD_Upscale
Examples below are accompanied by a [tutorial in my YouTube video](https://youtu.be/FR5MlDPByA0).

This ComfyUI nodes setup lets you use [Ultimate SD Upscale](https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale) custom nodes in your ComfyUI AI genertation routine.

You can easily utilize schemes below for your custom setups. Simply save and then drag and drop relevant image into your [ComfyUI interface window](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) with ControlNet Tile model istalled, load image (if applicable) you want to upsacale/edit, modify some prompts, press "Queue Prompt," and wait for the AI generation to complete. 

Stable Diffusion model used in this demonstration is [Lyriel](https://civitai.com/models/22922/lyriel?modelVersionId=72396).

Video tutorial on how to use ComfyUI, a powerful and modular Stable Diffusion GUI and backend, is [here](https://youtu.be/Ij8k6mBgL3o).
